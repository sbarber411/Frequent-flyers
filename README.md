## Frequent Flyers Overview:
- - -
Frequent Flyers is an application developed by a cheer team mom. While traveling across the country during national cheer season, most cheer parents need one concise location to store all of their travel itinerary information to make travel easier. Frequent Flyers allows its' users to select the National Cheer Competition they are attending. Once the National Cheer Competition is selected, users may select the "view itinerary" link to add their outbound and inbound flights as well as their accomodations information. If you make a mistake and need to edit the National Cheer Competition users are able to do so. Users may also delete the National Cheer Competition and all of its' attached itinerary information once it has ended as well.
